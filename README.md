## ClojureScript React Native with Shadow, Hx, and React Navigation

An example live-reloading ClojureScript project that combines:

* [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org/)
* [lilactown/hx](https://github.com/Lokeh/hx)
* [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

Based on https://github.com/thheller/reagent-react-native/

The more I've been using react native, the more I've come to appreciate
[lilactown/hx](https://github.com/Lokeh/hx) as a thin wrapper over react. [More info here](https://github.com/Lokeh/hx/blob/master/docs/why-not-reagent.md).
